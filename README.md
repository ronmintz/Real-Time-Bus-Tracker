# Real Time Bus Tracker

<p>Displays a map of Cambrdige, Masachusetts and part of Boston.  Markers on the map indicate the actual real-time position
   of each bus on the Boston MBTA #1 bus route.  These positions are obtained by accessing an MBTA website in real-time.
   I have added the improvement of using the color of each marker on the map to indicate the direction in which the bus that
   it represents is going.  Blue markers indicate buses going toward Harvard Square.  Red markers indicate buses going away
   from Harvard Square towards Boston.
</p>
<p>To run this project, clone this repository to a PC and double-click on the icon for index.html in the File Explorer.
   The map with markers showing the current position of the buses will appear.  This bus line does not run from about 1 am
   to 4:30 am, so no buses will appear on the map during this period.
</p>
<p>Possible future improvements include asking the user to select the bus line to be displayed on the map.  Multiple bus lines can be shown using different color markers for the buses on each line.
